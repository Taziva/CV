## Shoniwa Marovatsanga

After graduating from university I began working in the music industry. It was during this time that I discovered and became fascinated with software development. The concept of using creativity to solve problems and make ideas into reality struck a chord with me and ignited a new drive to learn more about programming. I then took part in several courses to learn the fundamentals of programming including a Microsoft Certification in Web Development Fundamentals and I am also currently attending Makers Academy. After finishing Makers Academy I hope to find a Junior Developer role in a diverse organisation crafts outstanding and creative software that either solves current problems or pushes society forward to a brighter future.
