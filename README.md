## Shoniwa Marovatsanga

I am a junior full stack developer looking to learn and work on creative innovative ideas that can ave a positive effect on the world. One of my core beliefs is the concept of social responsibility, as an individual I want to make sure that the majority of my life's work goes towards improving people's lives in any shape or form and I believe continuous learning may be the key to achieving this.

I found Makers Academy very beneficial to my growth as a developer as I was taught the two sides of being a great professional developer. On one side I was taught the best practices when it comes to creating good expandable software and writing good code. On the other side Makers Academy gave me a great environment to learn and practice the Extreme Programming XP values in an environment that closely simulated real work environments.

## Projects

| Project Repo & Site  | Description | Technology | Struggles | Enjoyed |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|---------|
|[Deveoper's Dictionary Repo](https://github.com/KatHicks/developers-dictionary)<br>**[Visit the Live Site](http://www.developers-dictionary.co.uk/)** | A fun and engaging definitions resource for software developers. | MongoDB, Express, Node.js, SVG, Bootstrap. **Testing:** Mocha, Chai, Zombie, Should.  | To make our project fun and engaging we decided to incorporate a wheel with all of our defined terms. It was hard to manage the implementation of something we had not done before| After having spent a few weekends practicing using a javascript stack it was good to finally use it for a project and the fact that our work is now live |
|[Majordomo Repo](https://github.com/sliute/majordomo)<br>**[Demo on Heroku](https://majordomo-makers.herokuapp.com/)** | A room booking and occupancy web app. It allows users to book rooms for meetings in the Makers Academy Building. It comes with a green and red status screen for when the room is in use | Ruby 2.3.3, Rails 5.0.1, Postgresql, date_validator, Haml, simple_calendar, Bootstrap. **Testing:** Rspec-rails & Capybara  | After just recently learnt Rails trying to use it to create a full scale project started off a bit difficult but got easier with time. | Participating in this project gave me the opportunity to refresh my front-end knowledge to create a beautiful interface.|

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Solving problems is essentially the purpose of software developing, and so in order to be a good software developer it is important to be a good problem solver. Taking on board this belief I have worked hard to improve my problem solving skills and techniques by opening my self up to different programming situations and experiences, for example during group projects if a a pairing came across a bug I would work with them to solve it or if that was not possible I would enquire as to the nature of how they solved it in order to absorb some of techniques they could've used to find it.


#### Continuos Learning

In order to improve something one must first understand it, and in order to understand it you must first learn about it. When I started working at Music Concierge I grew attached to this ethos and applied it to my daily work day always trying to learn a new way to make my job more efficient, to make my job easier but producing higher quality and it was a such a success that I decided to apply it every aspect of my life in order to improve my life and of those around me. On a daily basis I am always trying to learn something new, which could help me to achieve my goals.

#### Good Collaborator

As the saying goes no man is an island, it is very hard for man to achieve great things working alone as collaboration has always been the key to innovation. In order to build the world we currently live in humans have always worked together to build a bigger and brighter future. In software development collaboration is an important part of every project from working in groups to deliver good products to pair programming in order to write great maintainable code, with this in mind I actively work to maintain a great level of engagement and participation on every project I take part in using the Extreme Programming XP values to try and make sure every project is a good experience for everyone.
